index_title: Cookbook of a Diabetic!!!
index_description:
  As a diabetic, I follow a very low carb diet. Add to that mix the constraint 
  that I prefer vegetarian options often and I was soon experimenting with a 
  lot of my pre low carb favourites to create something pallatable. As a result
  I have a growing collection of recipes which I hope other people following low 
  carb may find helpful too.

# enable, set this option to any non-empty value (other than "false" in recent
# versions of Pandoc). To disable, keep it blank.

# If you maintain your recipes in a GitHub repository, you can specify its URL
# here – if non-empty, an "Edit" link will be shown at the bottom of each recipe
# page, referring you to the corresponding Markdown file on GitHub. If you've
# got some sort of continous integration (like the included GitHub Action) set
# up, this effectively turns your site into a wiki.

# Remote for deployment – the value of this setting will be passed to rsync as a

# it's correct – the path in particular – since otherwise stuff that shouldn't
# be deleted or overwritten might indeed be deleted or overwritten!
